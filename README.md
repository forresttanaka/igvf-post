# igvf-post

This posts objects of a specific type defined in a tsv file to a running igvfd instance.

## TSV File Objects

The first row of the tsv file comprises the postable property names. Each row below that describes an object to post to the database. For example, for a schema that describes objects like this:

```
[
  {
    "status": "released",
    "lab": "/labs/j-michael-cherry/",
    "viewing_group": "IGVF"
  },
  {
    "status": "in progress",
    "lab": "/labs/j-michael-cherry/",
    "viewing_group": "community"
  }
]
```

...the TSV file would contain:

| status      | lab                     | viewing_group |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| released    | /labs/j-michael-cherry/ | IGVF          |
| in progress | /labs/j-michael-cherry/ | community     |

## Special Properties

By default, values get treated as strings. But some properties have other types, and each property with a non-string type has a suffix describing the type after the property name.

### Date

For properties with the number type, suffix the property name with `-date`.

| status   | lab                     | starting_date-date |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| released | /labs/j-michael-cherry/ | 1/1/2022           |

All dates get written to the database as YYYY-MM-DD regardless of how they appear in the TSV file.

### Array

Append `-array` to all properties with an array type. The values get entered comma separated:

| status   | lab                     | pi-array                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| released | /labs/j-michael-cherry/ | /labs/j-michael-cherry/,/labs/ali-mortazavi/ |

The array elements must have a string type. I donâ€™t support arrays of dates for example.

### Number

Append `-number` to all properties with the number type.

| status   | lab                     | lower_bound_age-number |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| released | /labs/j-michael-cherry/ | 40                     |

## Targeting an Instance

You specify which demo to post to through the keypairs.json file. Following the existing examples, make an entry with an arbitrary name as the object key. Enter the URL for the target instance without a trailing slash with the "server" property.

## Authentication

You must first generate and provide access keys to post objects to the target igvfd instance. You can generate these keys through igvf-ui that's connected to the target igvfd instance and signing in. Go to your user profile and click Create Access Key. Copy the access key ID and secret to the "key" and "secret" properties under the corresponding entry of keypairs.json.
